# PHASE 3A: Workflow Context Validation Test Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to use the comprehensive test scripts created for **PHASE 3A** validation of the Super Code Node's workflow context features, specifically the `$()` function and n8n globals that were previously missing.

## Test Scripts Created

### 1. `test-workflow-context-validation.js`

**Primary Validation Script**

- **Purpose**: Comprehensive test suite for validating ALL workflow context features
- **Key Focus**: Tests the `$()` function (the main missing feature) and n8n globals
- **Test Coverage**: 9 test suites covering 22+ individual validations

**Test Suites Included:**

1. **Core $() Function** - Critical test for node referencing capability
2. **N8N Global Variables** - `$env`, `$workflow`, `$execution`, `$now`, `$today`, `$jmespath`
3. **Workflow Helper Functions** - `$getNodeParameter`, `$getWorkflowStaticData`
4. **Helpers Object Structure** - HTTP request helpers, execution metadata
5. **Enhanced $input Features** - `all()`, `first()`, `last()`, `json` methods
6. **Pre-loaded Libraries** - lodash, dayjs, uuid, validator, joi, moment, cheerio
7. **Isolation Testing** - Ensures workflow context doesn't conflict with libraries
8. **Feature Matrix** - Comprehensive scoring across all categories
9. **Standard Code Node Compatibility** - Direct comparison with expected behavior

### 2. `test-cases/mock-n8n-context.js`

**Mock Environment Demonstration**

- **Purpose**: Shows expected behavior when workflow context is properly available
- **Usage**: Demonstrates how tests should pass in real n8n environment
- **Validation**: Confirms test logic is correct

## How to Use These Tests

### In Development/Testing Environment

```bash
# Run the comprehensive validation (will show failures outside n8n)
node test-workflow-context-validation.js

# Run the mock context demo (will show expected success behavior)
node test-cases/mock-n8n-context.js
```

### In n8n Super Code Node

1. **Copy the test code** from `test-workflow-context-validation.js`
2. **Paste into a Super Code Node** in your n8n workflow
3. **Run the workflow** to see actual validation results
4. **Check for 90%+ pass rate** and critical test success

## Expected Results

### Outside n8n (Current Results)

```
üìà Overall Pass Rate: 0% (0/22)
üéØ Critical Tests: ‚ùå FAILED
‚ùå INCOMPLETE: Critical workflow context features still missing
```

### Inside n8n Super Code Node (Target Results)

```
üìà Overall Pass Rate: 95%+ (20+/22)
üéØ Critical Tests: ‚úÖ PASSED
‚úÖ SUCCESS: $() function and workflow context features are working!
```

## Critical Success Criteria

For **PHASE 3A** to be considered complete, these tests MUST pass:

1. **`$() Function Availability`** - Core node referencing capability
2. **`$getNodeParameter Function`** - Parameter access
3. **`Standard Code Node Compatibility`** - Full compatibility check

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] `$()` function is available and functional
- [ ] `$getNodeParameter` and `$getWorkflowStaticData` work
- [ ] `helpers` object is properly injected
- [ ] Enhanced `$input` methods work (`all`, `first`, `last`, `json`)
- [ ] Pre-loaded libraries don't conflict with workflow context
- [ ] Overall compatibility score ‚â• 90%
- [ ] No critical test failures

## Troubleshooting

### If Tests Fail in n8n

1. **Check Super Code Node version** - Ensure using latest build
2. **Verify workflow context injection** - Look for `getWorkflowDataProxy` in node code
3. **Check console output** - Review specific failure messages
4. **Test individual features** - Use simplified tests to isolate issues

### Common Issues

- **`$() not defined`**: Workflow data proxy not properly injected
- **Library conflicts**: Pre-loaded libraries interfering with n8n globals
- **Missing helpers**: Execution context not fully passed to sandbox

## Next Steps After PHASE 3A

Once these tests show ‚â•90% pass rate with critical tests passing:

1. **PHASE 3B**: Performance optimization testing
2. **PHASE 4**: Production deployment validation
3. **Documentation updates** for new workflow context features

**Goal**: Prove that Super Code Node now has the same workflow context capabilities as the standard Code node, plus the added bonus of pre-loaded libraries.

**Success Metric**: `$()` function works, workflow context is fully available, and compatibility is ‚â•90%.
