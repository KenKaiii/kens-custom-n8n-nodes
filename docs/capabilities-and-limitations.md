```

### Database Operations

- NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Redis)
- Connection pooling and management
- Prepared statements for security
- Batch operations for performance
- Transaction management

```

### Real-time Processing
```typescript

```

### Advanced Node Architectures
```typescript
// ‚úÖ EXCELLENT - Complex node patterns

- Dynamic input/output configuration
- Conditional property display
- Complex UI components with validation
- Node-to-node communication patterns
- Memory and context management systems
- Protocol implementations (WebSocket, MCP, etc.)
```

## üî¥ What ISN'T Possible - Avoid These Patterns

### File System Operations
```typescript
// ‚ùå SECURITY RISK - Avoid entirely
‚ùå Direct file reading/writing
‚ùå Directory traversal operations
‚ùå Temporary file creation
‚ùå File system monitoring
‚ùå Log file manipulation

// ‚úÖ ALTERNATIVE - Use n8n's built-in file handling
- Binary data processing through n8n's system
- Cloud storage APIs (S3, Google Drive, etc.)
- Database blob storage
```

### System Command Execution
```typescript
// ‚ùå MAJOR SECURITY RISK - Never implement
‚ùå shell.exec() or child_process operations
‚ùå System command invocation
‚ùå Process spawning
‚ùå Operating system interactions
‚ùå Environment variable manipulation

// ‚úÖ ALTERNATIVE - Use appropriate APIs
- Use specific service APIs instead of CLI tools
- HTTP requests to containerized services
- Message queue systems for job processing
```

### Long-Running Processes
```typescript
// ‚ùå ARCHITECTURE VIOLATION - Nodes must complete quickly
‚ùå Background daemon processes
‚ùå Persistent connections beyond single execution
‚ùå Long-polling operations > 30 seconds
‚ùå Blocking synchronous operations
‚ùå Infinite loops or continuous monitoring

// ‚úÖ ALTERNATIVE - Use proper patterns
- Webhook-based event handling
- External job queue systems
- n8n's built-in scheduling and triggers
```

### Complex State Management
```typescript
// ‚ùå STATELESS VIOLATION - Nodes can't persist state
‚ùå In-memory caches between executions
‚ùå Session storage or cookies
‚ùå Global variables for state
‚ùå File-based persistence
‚ùå Database state tied to node instances

// ‚úÖ ALTERNATIVE - Use external systems
- Redis for caching
- Database for persistence  
- n8n's memory nodes for context
- External state management services
```

## üö® Critical Technical Constraints

### Memory Limitations
```yaml
# No hard memory limits but practical constraints:
Safe Range: < 100MB per execution
Warning Zone: 100-500MB (monitor carefully)  
Danger Zone: > 500MB (likely to fail)

# Memory-heavy operations that can cause issues:
- Large JSON datasets (>10MB)
- Binary data processing
- Complex object transformations
- Recursive algorithms
- Large array operations
```

### Execution Time Boundaries
```yaml
# Default: No timeout, but practical limits apply
Recommended: < 30 seconds per node
Warning: 30-60 seconds (may timeout in production)
Danger: > 60 seconds (likely to fail)

# Operations that commonly exceed limits:
- Large API responses
- Complex data transformations
- Multiple sequential API calls
- Heavy computational tasks
```

### Architecture Requirements
```typescript
// ‚úÖ REQUIRED - All nodes must follow these patterns
interface NodeRequirements {
  // Stateless execution
  execution: 'stateless';
  
  // Return proper data structure
  output: INodeExecutionData[][];
  
  // Handle errors gracefully
  errorHandling: 'try-catch-with-meaningful-messages';
  
  // Validate inputs
  inputValidation: 'strict-type-checking';
  
  // Support batch processing
  batchProcessing: 'item-by-item-loops';
}
```

## üéì Key Takeaways for 2025

1. **Focus on Integration** - n8n nodes excel at connecting systems
2. **Embrace Statelessness** - Design for single-execution patterns
3. **Prioritize Security** - Never trust external inputs
4. **Optimize for Performance** - Keep executions under 30 seconds
5. **Leverage n8n's Strengths** - Use built-in authentication and data flow
6. **Modern AI Integration** - Support dynamic routing and multi-model patterns

When in doubt, ask: "Does this integrate systems safely and efficiently?" If yes, it's probably a good fit for an n8n custom node.
